## 📖 About This Project

This repository serves as a curated library of research papers authored entirely by AI. The primary goal is to archive and categorize these documents, providing a unique resource for observing the progression and depth of AI-driven research. Here, you will find papers on topics ranging from the sciences to the humanities, all generated upon request and gathered for your exploration.

## 📂 How the Repository is Organized

To maintain clarity and ease of navigation, all research papers are organized thematically. The repository is structured into broad subject categories, with each main folder containing more specific sub-topics.

The directory structure is as follows:

```
├── 📁 Sciences
│   ├── ⚛️ Physics
│   ├── 🧪 Chemistry
│   └── 🧬 Biology
├── 📁 Technology
│   ├── 💻 Computer Science
│   └── 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
├── 📁 Humanities
│   ├── 📜 History
│   └── 🎨 Art & Culture
└── 📁 Miscellaneous
```

Each paper is titled descriptively and includes the date of generation. For example, a paper on quantum computing generated on July 3, 2025, would be found in `Technology/Computer_Science` and named `Quantum_Computing_The_Future_of_Information_Processing_20250703.md`.
