# The National Firearms Act and Its Correlation with Criminal Activity: A 90-Year Statistical and Legal Analysis

## Part I: The Legislative and Regulatory Framework of the National Firearms Act

### Section 1.1: Genesis of the NFA (1934): Targeting the "Gangster Weapon"

The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA), enacted on June 26, 1934, represents the United States' first major federal foray into the regulation of firearms.1 Its passage was not a spontaneous legislative action but the culmination of growing public anxiety and political pressure fueled by a period of unprecedented and highly publicized violent crime. The ostensible impetus for the NFA was the gangland violence that defined the Prohibition era, a period marked by the rise of powerful, well-armed organized crime syndicates.2 These criminal enterprises, enriched by the lucrative black market for alcohol, operated with a level of brazen violence that shocked the nation. High-profile incidents, such as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago in 1929 and the attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, became powerful symbols of a nation seemingly losing control to lawlessness.2

During this period, the tools of criminal violence evolved. Gangs outfitted themselves with military-grade firepower, most notably the Thompson submachine gun, or "Tommy gun," and sawed-off shotguns.6 These weapons, capable of inflicting mass casualties quickly, transformed city streets into virtual war zones and left local law enforcement agencies, which were often outgunned and hobbled by jurisdictional limits, unable to cope effectively.7 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that by 1926, more than 12,000 murders were taking place annually across the United States, a staggering figure for the time.7 In Chicago alone, an estimated 1,300 gangs were active by the mid-1920s.7 This surge in violent crime, particularly homicides and assaults, between 1920 and 1933 created the political climate necessary for federal intervention.8

In response, Attorney General Homer Cummings championed a legislative solution that would target these specific "gangster weapons".11 The resulting National Firearms Act was ingeniously structured not as an outright ban, which would have faced significant constitutional and political hurdles, but as an exercise of Congress's formidable taxing power under the Internal Revenue Code.2 The law's primary mechanism was the imposition of a substantial excise tax on the manufacture and transfer of regulated firearms.1 This tax was set at $200, a sum considered prohibitively expensive in 1934, equivalent to over $4,700 in current dollars.2 The legislative intent was clear: the tax was not primarily for revenue collection but was designed to discourage or entirely eliminate transactions in these specific firearms by making them financially inaccessible and creating a detailed paper trail for every transaction.5

To enforce this tax and tracking scheme, the NFA mandated the creation of a national registry for all regulated firearms. This central federal database, known as the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (NFRTR), was to be maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Internal Revenue, the predecessor to the modern Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).1 Every NFA firearm, upon its creation or transfer, had to be registered in the NFRTR, with the record containing the weapon's details and the owner's identity.1 Any transfer of ownership required prior approval from the Treasury Department and payment of the $200 tax.1

The legislation was narrowly tailored, targeting only those weapons perceived as uniquely dangerous and favored by criminals. The original items regulated under the 1934 Act were:

- **Machine Guns:** Defined as firearms capable of firing automatically more than one shot with a single function of the trigger.3
    
- **Short-Barreled Rifles (SBRs):** Rifles with a barrel or barrels less than 18 inches in length (this was later amended to 16 inches).2
    
- **Short-Barreled Shotguns (SBSs):** Shotguns with a barrel or barrels less than 18 inches in length.2
    
- **Firearm Mufflers and Silencers:** Any device designed to diminish the report of a firearm.2
    
- **Any Other Weapon (AOW):** A catch-all category for concealable or disguised firearms that were not conventional pistols or revolvers, such as pen guns, cane guns, or smooth-bore handguns designed to fire shotgun shells.2
    

Notably, conventional pistols and revolvers, though widely used in crime, were initially considered for inclusion but were ultimately excluded from the final version of the Act before its passage.2 This deliberate exclusion underscores the targeted nature of the legislation. The NFA was not an attempt at universal firearm registration or a broad restriction on common handguns. It was a strategic effort to disrupt the criminal ecosystem by making the specific "tools of the trade" for notorious gangsters prohibitively expensive, difficult to acquire anonymously, and easy for law enforcement to track. This focused approach is fundamental to understanding the law's design and its subsequent effects on criminal behavior.

A significant challenge in evaluating the NFA's immediate impact is the state of crime data from the era. While the law was a direct response to a perceived crime wave, reliable, standardized national crime statistics from the 1920s and early 1930s are notoriously poor, incomplete, or nonexistent.14 Most available data from the period are known to underestimate the true extent of crime, giving a potentially false impression of crime trends.14 The first systematic efforts at national crime data collection were in their infancy, with many reports being of little scientific value.16 The justification for the NFA, therefore, was based more on high-profile, sensationalized events and the resulting public perception of a crisis than on a rigorous statistical analysis of crime rates, which was simply not available to policymakers at the time. Any analysis of the NFA's effectiveness must therefore acknowledge that the "baseline" crime level against which its impact is measured is poorly defined, making it exceedingly difficult to isolate the law's effects from other powerful confounding factors of the era, most notably the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.

### Section 1.2: Expansion and Evolution: The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA)

For over three decades, the National Firearms Act of 1934 remained the principal piece of federal firearms legislation. This changed dramatically with the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). The GCA was a sweeping piece of legislation, enacted in the wake of the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It fundamentally reshaped the landscape of federal firearms law and significantly amended the NFA framework. The GCA became known as "Title I" of federal firearms law, while the NFA was re-designated as "Title II," a nomenclature that reflects their integrated, yet distinct, functions.2

The GCA expanded the scope of the NFA in several key ways. First, it added a new category of regulated items: "destructive devices" (DDs). This broad category includes explosive and incendiary devices such as bombs, grenades, mines, and rockets, as well as firearms with a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter, with some exceptions for sporting shotguns.1 Second, the GCA clarified and expanded the definition of a "machine gun" to explicitly include the frame or receiver of such a weapon, as well as any parts or conversion kits designed to turn a semi-automatic firearm into a fully automatic one.1 This was a critical update, demonstrating a legislative understanding that the core regulated feature was the capability of automatic fire, not merely a specific factory-built weapon. By regulating the essential components, Congress attempted to prevent circumvention of the law through the modification of legal firearms. This effort was prescient, foreshadowing the modern law enforcement challenge posed by easily accessible machine gun conversion devices, though the technological ease of producing such items today far exceeds what was envisioned in 1968.

Perhaps the most critical function of the GCA's amendments to the NFA was to address a significant constitutional vulnerability that had rendered the 1934 Act virtually unenforceable. In the 1968 Supreme Court case _Haynes v. United States_, the Court held that the NFA's requirement for an individual to register an already-possessed, unregistered firearm violated the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.5 The logic was that by registering the illegal weapon, the possessor was admitting to a federal crime. To cure this constitutional flaw, the GCA amended the NFA in two crucial ways. First, it removed the requirement for possessors to register their existing unregistered firearms, making it impossible for an individual to retroactively legalize an illicit NFA weapon.5 Second, and more importantly, it added a provision that prohibited any information from a legitimate NFA application or registration from being used as evidence against the applicant in a criminal proceeding concerning a violation of law that occurred before or at the time of filing.5 This immunity provision removed the self-incrimination issue for prospective, law-abiding applicants and made the NFA's regulatory scheme constitutionally sound and enforceable once again.

Beyond these direct amendments, the GCA transformed the NFA from a standalone tax-and-register scheme into an integrated component of a much broader federal regulatory system. The GCA established the Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) system, which requires all persons engaged in the business of manufacturing or dealing in firearms to be federally licensed.12 It also created categories of "prohibited persons"—including convicted felons, fugitives from justice, and individuals adjudicated as mentally defective—who are barred from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms.22 This created a multi-layered control mechanism. To legally acquire an NFA item after 1968, an individual not only had to navigate the NFA's stringent application, taxation, and registration process but also had to be a non-prohibited person under the GCA. This meant that every NFA transfer was subject to two layers of federal scrutiny: the GCA's check on the eligibility of the person and the NFA's check on the registration and legal status of the specific item being transferred. This integration of the two statutory schemes created a far more robust and restrictive regulatory environment than the NFA had provided on its own.

### Section 1.3: The 1986 Firearm Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) and the Machine Gun Ban

The next major legislative development affecting the NFA came with the Firearm Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), signed into law on May 19, 1986.23 FOPA was a complex and controversial piece of legislation. Its primary stated purpose was to reform the Gun Control Act of 1968, addressing what many gun owners and parts of the firearms industry viewed as overly burdensome regulations and abusive enforcement practices by the ATF.22 The Act rolled back certain restrictions, for example, by allowing for the interstate sale of long guns between private citizens (provided the transaction was facilitated by an FFL in the buyer's state), legalizing ammunition shipments through the U.S. Postal Service, and raising the standard of proof for certain violations to "willful".22

However, during the final stages of its passage through the House of Representatives, a last-minute amendment was introduced by Representative William J. Hughes of New Jersey.23 This provision, commonly known as the "Hughes Amendment," dramatically altered the landscape for one of the key categories of NFA firearms. The amendment, codified in federal law as 18 U.S.C. § 922(o), made it "unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun".24 This created a general prohibition on the civilian possession of machine guns.

The critical feature of this new law was its exception clause. The ban did not apply to machine guns that were "lawfully possessed before the date this subsection takes effect," which was May 19, 1986.5 This provision effectively "closed the registry" for new machine guns available to the civilian market. While manufacturers could still produce new machine guns, these post-1986 weapons could only be sold to qualified government entities, such as the U.S. military and federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, or be held by specially licensed manufacturers and dealers for development or demonstration purposes.3 No new machine guns manufactured after that date could be registered for transfer to an ordinary private citizen.

The immediate and profound consequence of this ban was the creation of a finite, static supply of legally transferable civilian machine guns. Every machine gun that was legally registered in the NFRTR as of May 19, 1986, became part of a closed, national pool of "transferable" machine guns. This legislative action created an economic schism in the NFA market. By capping the supply of a desirable and collectible item, the law transformed transferable machine guns from simply regulated firearms into a class of high-value, investment-grade assets. Basic economic principles of supply and demand took hold; with a fixed supply and continued demand from collectors and enthusiasts, prices for transferable machine guns skyrocketed. Weapons that might have cost a few hundred dollars before the ban soon cost thousands, and today, prices routinely exceed $10,000 to $20,000 or more for common models, with rare examples fetching much higher sums.23 This economic barrier, created as a direct consequence of the legal prohibition, is arguably as significant as the legal restrictions themselves in preventing these weapons from being used in crime. The high value makes them an unattractive target for theft and an impossible purchase for a typical criminal. This economic disincentive is a powerful, if perhaps unintended, consequence of the ban and a key factor in the near-total absence of legally registered machine guns from crime statistics.

While the machine gun ban was the most significant part of FOPA related to the NFA, the Act also made other modifications. It amended the NFA's definition of a "silencer" to explicitly include any combination of parts designed for assembling a silencer and any part intended only for that purpose.5 It also further refined the definition of a "machinegun" to include any part designed and intended

_solely and exclusively_ for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.24

The 1986 ban on new machine guns, however, appears to have had a significant unintended consequence. While the law was successful in preventing new, legally registered machine guns from entering the civilian market, it did not eliminate the demand for automatic-fire capability. Instead, it created a powerful market incentive for the development and proliferation of illegal alternatives. This directly fueled the black market for unregistered conversion devices, such as "Glock switches" and auto-sears, which are now a primary focus of ATF enforcement. The restriction on the legal supply did not erase the desire for the capability; it displaced that demand into an illicit, unregulated, and technologically evolving black market. This dynamic, where a prohibition on a legal good leads to the rise of a dangerous illegal substitute, is a classic example of market substitution in a criminal context and is central to understanding the modern challenges of regulating NFA-type weapons.

**Table 2: State-by-State Legality of NFA Item Possession**

The National Firearms Act establishes a federal floor for regulation, but states retain the authority to enact more restrictive laws. The legality of possessing NFA items therefore varies significantly across the country, creating a complex patchwork of rules that overlays the federal framework. This table illustrates that federal approval to own an NFA item does not guarantee the right to possess it in every jurisdiction.

## Part II: Statistical Analysis of NFA Items in Criminal Activity

### Section 2.1: The Data Void: Challenges in Tracking NFA Firearm Crime

A comprehensive statistical analysis of the criminal use of NFA-regulated items is profoundly complicated by a significant and persistent challenge: the absence of a specific, centralized, publicly accessible federal database designed to track such incidents. Despite the NFA's 90-year history, no single government report systematically quantifies crimes committed with these specific weapons, particularly those that are legally registered.27 This "data void" is a critical finding in itself and necessitates a methodological approach that synthesizes information from a mosaic of ancillary sources.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the primary agency responsible for enforcing the NFA, publishes annual "Facts and Figures" reports. While these documents provide valuable data on the agency's regulatory activities—such as the number of NFA applications received and processed, and the amount of taxes collected—they do not contain statistics on crimes committed with NFA-regulated weapons.28 For fiscal year 2024, the ATF reported processing over 1.3 million NFA registration forms and collecting over $145 million in making and transfer taxes, but offered no corresponding data on the criminal misuse of the items being registered.28

The National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (NFRTR) is the cornerstone of the NFA system, but its function is regulatory, not criminological. The NFRTR is a registry of legal ownership and approved transfers, containing detailed records of each registered firearm and its lawful possessor.1 While law enforcement can query the NFRTR during an investigation to determine the legal status of a recovered weapon, its data is not aggregated or published in a way that links specific registered items to criminal incidents for public analysis. Furthermore, a 2006 audit by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (OIG) highlighted management deficiencies and technical flaws that contributed to errors in the NFRTR database, although it found no evidence that these errors had led to inappropriate criminal charges against legal owners.32

The nation's primary federal crime data collection programs, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), also lack the necessary granularity. These systems are designed to track broad categories of crime and do not typically differentiate weapons with the specificity required to identify them as NFA items.33 For instance, a UCR homicide report might categorize the weapon used as a "rifle" or "shotgun," but it will not specify whether it was a short-barreled rifle (SBR) or short-barreled shotgun (SBS) that would fall under the NFA's purview.

Similarly, the ATF's National Tracing Center provides crucial data on "crime guns," but its focus is on tracking the chain of commerce from the manufacturer to the first retail purchaser to generate investigative leads.30 The overwhelming majority of firearms traced are standard, non-NFA pistols, rifles, and shotguns. The trace process does not inherently identify a firearm as a legally registered NFA item.

This absence of a dedicated, official statistical report forces any analysis to rely on a patchwork of other sources, including ATF seizure reports, which often do not distinguish between registered and unregistered items; trafficking investigation summaries; academic studies; and credible anecdotal evidence from congressional testimony and investigative journalism.

The data void itself is a significant finding. Federal data collection efforts are typically driven by policy priorities and perceived public safety threats.36 The fact that neither the BJS nor the FBI has been directed to create a specific statistical category for "NFA weapon crime" over the past nine decades strongly suggests that the criminal use of

_legally registered_ NFA items has not been identified as a prevalent enough issue to warrant such a dedicated effort. This stands in stark contrast to emerging threats like privately made firearms ("ghost guns") or machine gun conversion devices (MCDs). In response to the surge in these items, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF have been proactive in launching task forces and publishing new, specific data to quantify the problem.29 In this context, the long-standing absence of official data on crimes with registered NFA items is, in itself, evidence suggesting the absence of a large-scale problem.

Furthermore, the difficulty in definitively verifying claims about NFA-related crime highlights the broader fragmentation of U.S. crime data. As one analysis pointed out, trying to confirm a claim like "only three crimes have been committed with legal machine guns since 1934" is a methodological quagmire, as it would require searching 90 years of arrest records across tens of thousands of disparate local, state, and federal databases, many of which are not digitized or standardized.40 This fragmentation means that while a strong consensus may exist about the rarity of such crimes, producing an unimpeachable, definitive number is practically impossible.

### Section 2.2: Criminal Use of Legally Registered NFA Firearms

Despite the statistical void, a strong and consistent consensus emerges from a wide array of sources, including government officials, academic researchers, and journalistic reports: the use of legally owned, properly registered NFA firearms in the commission of violent crime is exceedingly rare.39 The rigorous and multi-faceted regulatory process itself appears to be a primary reason for this phenomenon.

The process for legally acquiring an NFA item is deliberately onerous. It involves submitting a detailed application to the ATF (e.g., Form 4 for a transfer), providing fingerprints and photographs, undergoing an extensive FBI background check, paying the $200 tax stamp, and notifying the chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) in the applicant's jurisdiction.4 The entire process often involves a waiting period of several months to over a year for ATF approval. This combination of high cost (both the tax and the often-inflated price of the item itself), long wait times, and direct, documented interaction with a federal law enforcement agency creates a system that is fundamentally unattractive to individuals with immediate criminal intent. Criminals typically seek weapons that are cheap, readily accessible, and untraceable. The NFA process is the antithesis of this, effectively screening out impulsive actors and those unwilling to subject themselves to intense scrutiny. The process, therefore, tends to self-select for a demographic of highly motivated, patient, and often affluent hobbyists and collectors, a group with an extremely low statistical propensity for violent crime.

When examining specific categories of NFA items, the data, though sparse, reinforces this conclusion:

- **Machine Guns:** This category provides the most striking evidence. Since the Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 banned the new manufacture of transferable machine guns for civilians, the number of documented violent crimes committed with legally registered, pre-1986 transferable machine guns is vanishingly small. Multiple sources cite the number of such incidents as being between one and three in the nearly four decades since the ban.40 One of the most frequently cited cases involved a law enforcement officer in Ohio who used his registered machine gun to murder a police informant, an act committed by an agent of the state rather than an ordinary civilian.40 As far back as 1984, before the ban, the Director of the ATF testified before Congress that "Registered machineguns which are involved in crimes are so minimal so as not to be considered a law enforcement problem".44
    
- **Silencers (Suppressors):** Statistics for silencers are less definitive but point to the same trend of rare criminal use. One unconfirmed but widely circulated claim suggests there were 44 instances over a ten-year period where the ATF recommended prosecution for a crime involving a silencer.40 Given that there were over 1.3 million legally owned silencers in the country at the time of that claim, this would represent an infinitesimally small rate of misuse.40 However, the narrative surrounding silencers is highly susceptible to being influenced by "black swan" events—rare but high-impact occurrences. For example, the highly publicized 2025 killing of a UnitedHealthcare CEO in Manhattan, which reportedly involved a silencer, garnered significant media attention and was immediately injected into legislative debates about NFA deregulation.39 Such an event, while a statistical outlier, can have an outsized impact on public perception and policy discourse, overshadowing the data that indicates such use is extremely uncommon.
    
- **Short-Barreled Rifles (SBRs), Short-Barreled Shotguns (SBSs), and Other NFA Items:** Specific crime statistics for these categories are even more sparse than for machine guns and silencers. They are subject to the same stringent NFA regulatory scheme, which is widely believed to be the primary factor contributing to their low rate of criminal use. Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DOJ Office of the Inspector General have examined issues with federal firearms controls and the NFRTR database but have not identified a pattern of legally registered SBRs, SBSs, or AOWs being used in crime.32
    

In summary, the available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the NFA's comprehensive regulatory framework—combining background checks, registration, taxation, and significant wait times—has been exceptionally effective at preventing legally owned items from being used in crime. The system appears to function as a robust screen for criminal intent, ensuring that these specific categories of weapons remain almost exclusively in the hands of law-abiding collectors and enthusiasts.

### Section 2.3: The Illicit Market: Unregistered and Illegally Modified NFA-Type Weapons

While legally registered NFA items are virtually absent from crime statistics, a starkly different picture emerges when examining firearms that fall under the NFA's legal definitions but exist entirely outside its regulatory system. The primary "NFA crime problem" in the United States today does not involve legally owned, tax-stamped firearms. Instead, it is centered on a burgeoning illicit market for unregistered and illegally manufactured or modified NFA-type weapons. This distinction is critical for any accurate policy analysis. The term "NFA item" has a dual meaning: in the collector community, it refers to a legal, registered firearm; in the law enforcement community, it increasingly refers to an illegal weapon that meets the NFA's statutory definition.

This illicit market includes several types of weapons. Historically, the most common was the illegally "sawed-off" shotgun or rifle, a weapon modified after its initial sale to have a barrel shorter than the legal minimum, making it more concealable. ATF seizure data provides a snapshot of the scale of this problem. In 2006, for instance, the ATF reported seizing a total of 3,030 NFA-type weapons. This included 1,280 machine guns, 550 sawed-off shotguns and rifles, 571 silencers, and 415 destructive devices. These totals included both registered and unregistered weapons recovered during criminal investigations, indicating a substantial number of illicit NFA-type items in circulation.1

However, the most significant and alarming modern trend is the explosive proliferation of illegal machine gun conversion devices (MCDs). These are typically small, easily manufactured, and easily concealed devices—often referred to as "auto-sears" or, more commonly, "Glock switches"—that can be attached to a standard semi-automatic firearm, most often a pistol, to convert it into a machine gun in seconds.29 Under federal law, because an MCD is a "part designed and intended...for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun," the device itself is legally defined as a machine gun and is therefore a regulated NFA item.2

The rise of these devices represents a fundamental disruption of the NFA's 90-year-old regulatory model. The 1934 Act was designed for an industrial age, assuming that manufacturing a machine gun was a complex, factory-level process. The advent of technologies like 3D printing and the ease of global e-commerce have democratized the ability to produce or acquire MCDs, completely subverting the NFA's original assumptions. The statistics bear this out dramatically. In a January 2025 announcement, the Department of Justice reported a staggering **784% increase** in the law enforcement recovery of MCDs between fiscal years 2019 and 2023.29 This is not merely a statistical increase; it is evidence of a paradigm shift in the nature of the automatic weapons threat.

The DOJ has recognized the gravity of this development, launching a department-wide Anti-MCD Task Force in September 2024 to coordinate efforts to disrupt the trafficking and possession of these illegal devices.29 This problem is inextricably linked to the prevalence of the host weapons. ATF crime gun trace data shows that pistols are, by a wide margin, the most common type of firearm recovered from crime scenes, accounting for 74.2% of all traces between 2022 and 2023.37 This means the most common crime gun is also the one most easily and frequently converted into an illegal machine gun via an MCD.

ATF trafficking reports further confirm that NFA-type weapons, including machine guns, parts, conversion devices, and silencers, are actively trafficked in the illicit market.47 The modern NFA crime problem, therefore, is not one of diversion of legally registered, high-value collector pieces. It is a problem of widespread, low-cost, illicit manufacturing and trafficking of devices that can impart machine gun capabilities to the most common firearms found in criminal hands. Any analysis that conflates these two distinct phenomena—the legal registry and the illicit black market—will fail to grasp the reality of the current public safety threat. Policies aimed at legal owners, such as raising the NFA tax or adding more paperwork, would have no effect on the criminal who 3D-prints a Glock switch or buys one from an online black market. The two ecosystems are almost entirely separate.

## Part III: Correlation and Causation: Assessing the Impact of NFA Restrictions

### Section 3.1: Pre-NFA vs. Post-NFA Crime Trends

Determining a clear causal link between the passage of the National Firearms Act in 1934 and a subsequent decline in violent crime is an analytical exercise fraught with challenges, primarily due to the presence of powerful confounding variables and the poor quality of historical data. The popular narrative often credits the NFA with helping to end the "gangster era," but a rigorous examination reveals a more complex reality.

The single most significant confounding variable is the repeal of the 18th Amendment, which ended Prohibition in December 1933, just six months before the NFA was enacted. A substantial body of historical analysis attributes the high crime rates of the 1920s and early 1930s directly to the violent black market for alcohol created by Prohibition.2 With the end of Prohibition, this primary engine of organized crime revenue was dismantled. Homicide rates, which had steadily climbed throughout the Prohibition years, began a noticeable and sustained decline immediately following its repeal.8 This makes it statistically very difficult, if not impossible, to isolate the independent impact of the NFA from the far larger effect of legalizing alcohol.

A second major confounding factor was the concurrent professionalization and expansion of federal law enforcement. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under J. Edgar Hoover. The FBI was given new federal statutes to enforce, a national mandate to pursue interstate criminals, and modern tools and techniques, transforming it from a small, politicized bureau into a formidable national police force.7 This enhanced law enforcement capacity undoubtedly contributed to the decline of the high-profile outlaw gangs of the era.

Given these powerful external forces, the NFA's primary initial impact may have been more symbolic and deterrent than statistically measurable in overall crime rates. The law was a clear signal of a new federal resolve to combat organized crime, and it did so by targeting the highly visible symbols of that crime—the Thompson submachine gun and the sawed-off shotgun. By making these specific weapons more expensive, harder to acquire, and riskier to possess, the NFA likely had a significant deterrent effect on the _type_ of weaponry used by criminals. It may have effectively altered the "arsenal of crime," pushing criminals toward less conspicuous and less heavily regulated firearms, even if the overall decline in the crime rate was predominantly driven by the end of Prohibition and improved policing. The law appears to have been successful in its narrow, targeted goal: making the "gangster weapon" a liability rather than an asset for criminal enterprise.

Beyond its immediate effects, the NFA's most significant and enduring legacy is arguably its role in establishing the legal and conceptual precedent for all subsequent federal firearms regulation. Prior to 1934, firearms regulation was almost exclusively a state and local matter. By successfully framing the NFA as an exercise of the federal taxing power and having its constitutionality upheld—however narrowly—by the Supreme Court in the 1939 case of _United States v. Miller_, the federal government established a crucial legal foothold.11 This precedent paved the way for the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 and, most importantly, the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was based on the broader authority of the commerce clause.12 The NFA was, in effect, the "foot in the door" for federal involvement in firearms policy. This long-term, third-order effect on the entire legal landscape of American gun control is a critical aspect of its historical importance, far outweighing any immediate, statistically verifiable impact on crime rates in the 1930s.

### Section 3.2: The Impact of the 1986 Machine Gun Ban

The 1986 Firearm Owners' Protection Act, and specifically the Hughes Amendment which banned the civilian possession of newly manufactured machine guns, provides a much clearer case study for analyzing the correlation between a specific restriction and criminal activity. The effects of this ban have been twofold, creating a stark divergence between the legal and illegal markets for automatic weapons.

First, regarding legally owned items, the ban has been exceptionally effective. As established previously, the criminal use of legally registered, transferable machine guns manufactured before May 19, 1986, has been virtually nonexistent since the ban took effect.40 By freezing the legal supply, the law transformed these firearms into high-value collectibles. The resulting price explosion effectively priced them out of the criminal market entirely.23 For this specific, legally defined class of weapons, there is a clear and strong negative correlation: the total restriction on new legal supply correlates with a near-zero incidence of their use in crime.

However, the second effect of the ban reveals a different correlation. The prohibition on new legal machine guns created a market vacuum for the capability of automatic fire. This vacuum was inevitably filled by the illicit market, which responded with innovation. This led directly to the proliferation of illegal, unregistered alternatives, a trend that has culminated in the recent, dramatic surge in machine gun conversion devices (MCDs).29 Here, the correlation is positive: the severe restriction on the

_legal_ supply of machine guns is strongly correlated with the emergence and rapid growth of a new _illegal_ supply chain for functional equivalents.

This dynamic presents a classic example of what is sometimes termed the "Cobra Effect" in public policy, where an attempted solution to a problem inadvertently makes the problem worse. The 1986 law was intended to reduce the availability of machine guns to criminals. It succeeded spectacularly with regard to the legal, registered, and transferable machine guns of the era. However, it simultaneously incentivized the creation of a new, more insidious threat: a class of illegal machine guns (in the form of easily made and concealed conversion devices) that are cheaper, more accessible to criminals, and harder for law enforcement to track than the pre-1986 firearms ever were. The policy solved the problem as it was understood in 1986 but helped create the far more widespread and decentralized problem that law enforcement faces today.

It is also worth noting that some analyses have challenged the notion that the 1986 ban had a positive effect on reducing certain types of violence. One article points out that the frequency of mass shootings in the United States has increased since the 1986 ban was enacted.48 While correlation does not equal causation, and this trend is likely influenced by a multitude of complex social factors, it does call into question any simple claim that this specific prohibition directly resulted in a safer society. The evidence suggests that the primary impact of the 1986 ban was not to eliminate automatic weapons from the criminal landscape, but rather to shift their form from expensive, registered rifles to cheap, untraceable pistol conversion devices.

### Section 3.3: International Analogues: The Australian National Firearms Agreement (NFA)

To provide a broader context for the effects of firearms legislation, it is sometimes useful to examine international analogues. However, such comparisons must be made with extreme caution, as legal, cultural, and social contexts differ vastly. The Australian National Firearms Agreement (NFA) of 1996 is often cited in U.S. policy debates, but its relevance to the American NFA of 1934 is limited.

It is crucial to first distinguish between the two laws. The U.S. NFA of 1934 is a tax and registration scheme targeting specific, narrowly defined categories of weapons like machine guns and short-barreled shotguns. The Australian NFA of 1996, enacted after the Port Arthur mass shooting, was a far more sweeping set of restrictions. It included an outright ban on entire classes of common firearms, including all semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns, and was implemented via a massive, nationwide, compensated firearm buyback program that removed some 640,000 firearms from civilian possession.51

Decades of research on the Australian NFA have failed to produce a clear consensus on its effectiveness. The debate among criminologists and public health researchers is ongoing and contentious.

- Some studies conclude that the law had little to no statistically significant effect on firearm homicide rates, arguing that pre-existing downward trends in violence simply continued after the law's passage. These analyses suggest that any reductions in firearm deaths may have been offset by substitution to other methods.51
    
- Conversely, other studies have found a statistically significant acceleration in the decline of firearm suicides and homicides following the NFA's implementation. Proponents of this view also argue that the law has been successful in its primary goal of preventing further public mass shootings on the scale of Port Arthur.52
    
- A key methodological challenge that plagues all of this research is the difficulty of statistically separating the law's effect from the strong, pre-existing downward trend in violent crime and suicide that was already underway in Australia before 1996.54
    

The Australian experience thus serves as a powerful cautionary tale about the immense difficulty of establishing clear causation in the analysis of national gun policy. Even with a far more dramatic, uniform, and sweeping policy intervention than anything enacted in the United States, experts cannot agree on the Australian NFA's ultimate impact on violent crime. This underscores the even greater challenge of trying to assess the piecemeal, 90-year evolution of the U.S. NFA, which has been subject to numerous amendments and operates within a much more complex and varied legal environment.

Furthermore, the Australian case is of limited direct applicability to the U.S. context for several fundamental reasons. Australia lacks a constitutional protection for firearm ownership equivalent to the U.S. Second Amendment, which profoundly shapes the legal and political landscape. The two nations have vastly different gun cultures and historical relationships with firearms. The Australian NFA banned firearms (semi-automatic rifles) that are among the most common and popular types of firearms legally owned in the U.S. and are not regulated by the American NFA. Given these stark differences in law, culture, and the specific policies enacted, attempting to import conclusions from Australian studies—whether positive or negative—into the U.S. policy debate over its own NFA is a fundamentally flawed analytical approach. The two are not comparable, and the lessons learned from one are not easily transferable to the other.

## Part IV: Conclusion and Expert Insights

### Section 4.1: Synthesizing the Evidence

This comprehensive analysis of the National Firearms Act of 1934 and its subsequent 90-year history reveals a complex and often paradoxical relationship between the regulation of these specific firearms and their use in criminal activity. The evidence, drawn from legislative history, federal agency reports, and academic research, points to several key conclusions.

First, the NFA and its major amendments in 1968 and 1986 have successfully created a highly restrictive and robust regulatory environment for the specific categories of firearms and devices it governs. The combination of a prohibitive tax, a national registration system, extensive background checks, and long waiting periods has established formidable barriers to legal ownership.

Second, the data, despite its limitations, strongly indicates that this regulatory framework has been exceptionally effective at preventing legally registered NFA items from being used in violent crime. The criminal misuse of lawfully owned, tax-stamped NFA firearms—particularly transferable machine guns—is a statistically negligible phenomenon. This success can be attributed not only to the legal barriers but also to the economic ones, especially the sky-high prices for transferable machine guns created by the 1986 ban, which priced them out of the criminal market.

Third, a contrary and alarming trend has emerged. While the legal supply of NFA items is tightly controlled, a dangerous and rapidly growing illicit market has developed for functional equivalents. This is most evident in the explosive proliferation of illegal, unregistered machine gun conversion devices (MCDs). These cheap, easily made, and untraceable devices can convert the most common crime guns—semi-automatic pistols—into illegal machine guns.

Therefore, the NFA framework has been successful in its original, narrow goal of controlling the _legal_ population of these weapons and preventing their diversion into criminal hands. However, the most stringent of its restrictions—the 1986 ban on new machine guns—has correlated strongly with the growth of a dangerous _illicit_ market that circumvents the law entirely. The nature of the "NFA crime problem" has fundamentally shifted over the past decade from one of controlling a small number of expensive, factory-made weapons to one of combating a potentially vast number of cheap, illicitly made conversion devices.

### Section 4.2: Answering the Core Question of Correlation

The central query of this report concerns the correlation between restricting NFA items nationwide and their usage in crime. The analysis reveals a dual, nuanced correlation that points in opposite directions for the legal and illegal markets.

There is a **strong negative correlation** between the comprehensive regulation of NFA items through the legal registration process and their use in crime. That is, as the layers of restriction on legal ownership have been established and maintained, the criminal use of these legally owned items has diminished to a rate that is statistically near-zero. The NFA system, by design, makes legal acquisition impossible for prohibited persons and unattractive for those with criminal intent. In this respect, the restriction has been an unqualified success.

Simultaneously, there is a **strong positive correlation** between the most severe restriction—the 1986 ban on new civilian machine guns—and the emergence and proliferation of an illicit market for unregistered, functional alternatives. The prohibition on a legal supply channel did not eliminate demand for the capability of automatic fire; it displaced it into a criminal black market. This market has innovated to produce cheap, untraceable, and easily distributed machine gun conversion devices, which now represent the most significant NFA-related threat to public safety.

The ultimate conclusion on the correlation between restriction and crime is therefore paradoxical. Nationwide restriction has had a dual effect: it has effectively firewalled the legal, registered supply of NFA items from the world of criminal commerce, but it has also created powerful incentives for a criminal black market to innovate and supply illegal alternatives. Any policy discussion regarding the NFA must grapple with this duality. The framework has succeeded in controlling the items it can see and track, but in doing so, it has contributed to the rise of a shadow market of items that are, by their very nature, invisible to the regulatory system until they are recovered from a crime scene.

### Section 4.3: Recommendations for Data Collection and Policy Focus

Based on the comprehensive findings of this report, the following recommendations are offered to improve public understanding and inform effective policy.

1. **Enhance Data Collection and Transparency:** The significant "data void" identified in this report is a major impediment to evidence-based policymaking. Federal agencies, particularly the ATF and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), should be directed to develop and publish specific, regular, and public reports on the recovery and criminal use of all categories of NFA-type weapons. Critically, this reporting must clearly distinguish between legally registered items and illegal, unregistered items (such as MCDs or sawed-off shotguns). This would provide policymakers, researchers, and the public with the accurate data needed to assess the true nature and scale of the problem and to design targeted interventions.
    
2. **Prioritize Enforcement on Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking:** The data clearly indicates that the most acute and rapidly growing threat from NFA-type weapons comes from illegal machine gun conversion devices. Consequently, law enforcement resources and policy focus should be prioritized to combat this specific threat. This includes robust support for initiatives like the DOJ's ANTI-MCD Task Force and a focus on disrupting the entire illicit supply chain, from online vendors and foreign manufacturers to domestic 3D-printers and local traffickers. Strategies should be tailored to this modern, decentralized threat, which is distinct from the historical problem of regulating factory-made firearms.
    
3. **Promote Nuanced and Context-Aware Research:** Future criminological and legal research on the effectiveness of the NFA must be more nuanced. Studies should carefully disaggregate the effects of the law on legally registered items versus illegally manufactured ones, as these are two separate phenomena. Furthermore, researchers and policymakers should avoid simplistic international comparisons, such as citing the Australian NFA, without a rigorous accounting for the vast differences in legal, social, and political contexts. Future research should instead focus on the dynamics of illicit firearms market innovation and the specific drivers of demand for illegal items like MCDs within the domestic criminal environment.
